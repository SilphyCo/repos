<p>No artificial ingredients or pre-made sauces here—just fresh dough, a vibrant medley of vegetables, quality cheese, and herbs come together to create a wholesome, mouthwatering pizza that’s perfect for sharing with family and friends.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>All-purpose flour (for the dough)</li>
    <li>Active dry yeast</li>
    <li>Warm water</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Fresh garlic (minced)</li>
    <li>Fresh tomatoes (diced)</li>
    <li>Red bell pepper (thinly sliced)</li>
    <li>Mushrooms (sliced)</li>
    <li>Red onion (thinly sliced)</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese (for finishing)</li>
    <li>Oregano (dried or fresh)</li>
    <li>Crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for some heat)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy. Add flour, olive oil, and salt. Mix and knead for about 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rise in a warm spot for 1–1.5 hours, until doubled in size.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it inside to heat.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Make the fresh tomato base:</strong> In a bowl, combine diced tomatoes, minced garlic, a pinch of salt, olive oil, and oregano. Let it sit for 10 minutes to let the flavors blend.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface into your desired pizza shape and thickness.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Assemble the pizza:</strong> Spread the fresh tomato mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Layer the sliced red bell peppers, mushrooms, and red onion on top. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese generously over the vegetables. Add a few fresh basil leaves and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes if you like a little heat.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Transfer the pizza carefully to the preheated oven or pizza stone. Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Finish and serve:</strong> Remove from oven, sprinkle freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top and add extra fresh basil leaves for garnish. Slice and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade classic pizza with loved ones!</li>
