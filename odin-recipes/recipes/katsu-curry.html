<p>This comforting Japanese favorite uses fresh ingredients and simple techniques to create a crispy breaded cutlet served with a rich, flavorful curry sauce—no artificial additives, just wholesome goodness that will keep hunger at bay.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken breasts or pork cutlets (boneless, pounded thin)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Eggs (beaten)</li>
    <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    <li>Onion (finely chopped)</li>
    <li>Carrot (diced)</li>
    <li>Potatoes (peeled and diced)</li>
    <li>Garlic (minced)</li>
    <li>Ginger (grated)</li>
    <li>Japanese curry roux blocks (or homemade curry powder mix)</li>
    <li>Chicken or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>Cooked rice (for serving)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the cutlets:</strong> Season the chicken or pork with salt and pepper. Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: flour, beaten eggs, and panko breadcrumbs.</li>

    <li><strong>Bread the cutlets:</strong> Dredge each cutlet in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in the egg, then coat evenly with panko breadcrumbs. Set aside.</li>

    <li><strong>Fry the cutlets:</strong> Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan over medium heat. When hot, fry the breaded cutlets for 3–4 minutes per side until golden and cooked through. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>

    <li><strong>Make the curry sauce:</strong> In a separate pot, heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion, carrot, and potatoes. Cook for 5–7 minutes until vegetables soften. Add garlic and ginger, cooking 1 more minute.</li>

    <li><strong>Add broth and simmer:</strong> Pour in the broth, enough to cover the vegetables. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, until vegetables are tender.</li>

    <li><strong>Incorporate curry roux:</strong> Break the curry roux blocks into the pot and stir until fully dissolved. Simmer gently until sauce thickens, about 5 more minutes. Adjust seasoning as needed.</li>

    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slice the fried cutlets. Serve over a bed of steamed rice, topped generously with the curry sauce. Enjoy hot!</li>
